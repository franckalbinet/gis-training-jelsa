## Targeted skills
By the end of this module, you will know how to:
* create an animated thematic map based on available time attribute
* prepare a time attribute compliant to TimeManager plugin

## Data
* Romania admin layer
* ASF outbreaks

## Exercise outline & memos

In this module, given our previous analysis, we would like to perform a fine-grained analysis of the outbreak situation at a higher resolution (large scale) in the south west of Romania, especially in these counties:
* Ialomița
* Constanța
* Călărași
* Brăila
* Tulcea

### 1. Data preparation

Your tasks:

1. Select counties of interest and save it as new layer
2. Select ASF outbreaks data covered by this new area of interest
3. Save it as a new layer

Once, this is done, we would like to create a new layer with one single feature/polygon representing the contour of the area formed by 5 counties selected. This transformation is called **dissolving**. 

```
[In QGIS Processing Toolbox]
Write "dissolve" in the search box
and double-click on Vector geometry  ▸ Dissolve 
Choose the layer of interest and "Run"
Save it as new layer
```

By now, you should have three new layers (see screenshot below):
* the ASF outbreaks for these 5 counties
* the 5 counties selected as a new layer
* a layer with one single feature representing the contour of these 5 counties

### 2. Generate and clip a grid
