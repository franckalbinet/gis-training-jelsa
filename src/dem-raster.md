## Targeted skills
By the end of this module, you will know how to:
* download Digital Elevation Model from NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM)
* merge and clip tiles/images downloaded
* visualize and analyze it


## Data

## Exercise outline & memos

In this module, given our previous analysis, we would like to perform a fine-grained analysis of the outbreak situation at a higher resolution (large scale) in the south west of Romania, especially in these counties:
* Ialomița
* Constanța
* Călărași
* Brăila
* Tulcea

### 1. Data preparation

Your tasks:

1. Select counties of interest and save it as new layer
2. Select ASF outbreaks data covered by this new area of interest
3. Save it as a new layer

Once, this is done, we would like to create a new layer with one single feature/polygon representing the contour of the area formed by 5 counties selected. This transformation is called **dissolving**.
