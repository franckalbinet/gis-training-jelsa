## Targeted skills
By the end of this module, you will know how to:
* get access to countries administrative boundaries GIS layers
* perform a quick visual analysis of outbreaks density using "Heatmap"
* perform a spatial query to select features (point) of interest
* identify a CRS relevant to your region of interest and use case
* handle data attributes: add, delete, move, calculate, ...

## Data
Data to be used in this module can be found here:

```
data/asf-20180101-20190410.csv
```

## Exercise outline & memos

In this series of module, we will focus on **ASF (African Swine Fever) outbreaks data in Romania from 1st January 2018 to 10th April 2019**.

### 1. Practice "Day 1" acquired skills

* first, open "CartoDB Positron" XYZ tiles
* then load the `data/asf-20180101-20190410.csv` .csv file into QGIS and convert it to a Shapefile
* take a quick look at outbreak density worldwide

### 2. Getting access to countries administrative boundaries
Previously loaded outbreaks data cover the entire world. For the proposed use case, we will focus on Romania
