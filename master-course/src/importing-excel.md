> [GIS fundamentals | Training Course](agenda.md) ▸ **Importing Geo-referenced EMPRES Excel files**

## Targeted skills
By the end of this module, you will know how to:
* convert Excel file to csv (comma separated value) files
* import/convert csv file with lat, lon attributes into GIS layer
* overlay layer created over GoogleMap or OpenStreeMap layers

## Data
Data to be used in this module can be found in the following folders:
```
aiv-20180101-20190410.xlsx
aiv-20180101-20190410.csv
```

These files contain Avian Influenze Virus (AIV) data from 2018/01/01 to 2019/04/10 worldwide provided by the ["EMPRES: Global Animal Disease Information System" platform](http://empres-i.fao.org/eipws3g/)

## Exercise outline & memos

### 1. Converting Excel files to csv format
*CSV stands for Comma-Separated Value*

Before being able to import your data into QGIS as a plain GIS layer, you need to pre-process it via Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice for instance.

To do so for instance with Microsoft Excel:

```
Open: aiv-20180101-20190410.xlsx

[In Excel top menu] 
File ▸ Save As..
[In Save window/dialog]
Change "Format" dropdown to "Windows Comma Separated (.csv)
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You can follow a similar process using an Open Source equivalent to Microsoft Excel named OpenOffice [Download](https://www.openoffice.org/)

### 2. Importing/converting csv file with lat, lon attributes into GIS layer
```
[In QGIS top menu] 
Layer ▸ Add Layer ▸ Add Delimited Text Layer...
```
then reproduce settings shown below including:
* `File name`
* `File format`
* `Geometry CRS`
* ...

```
Click "OK"
```

At this stage, your geo-referenced file is visible in the QGIS map panel but you still need
to save it as a shapefile (or GeoPackage). 

To do so:
```
[In QGIS layers panel] 
Click right on your layer  ▸ Export  ▸ Save Features As

Choose "ESRI shapefile" format, a proper folder and save it with a meaningful name,
for instance: "aiv-20180101-20190410" (the file extension will be created automatically) - see screenshot below
```

**Congrats, you have created your first GIS layer / shapefile from scratch!**

### 3. Overlaying layer created over XYZ tiles (GoogleMap, OpenStreeMap layers, ...)

In previous QGIS versions 2.x, a dedicated plugin named "OpenLayers Plugin" allowed to load background image layers such as Google Map and the like. This plugin has not yet been adapted to the new QGIS version. However, there is a pretty straightforward to achieve the same result in the newest version.

```
Install "OpenLayers Plugin" if not already installed. If/when installed the plugin
needs to be activated (checkbox on).
```

```
[In QGIS top menu] 
Web ▸ OpenLayers plugin ▸ Google Maps ▸ Google Hybrid
```

Warning: Check order of layers in the Layers panel as the point layer might be lower in the stack
