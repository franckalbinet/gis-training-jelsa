## QGIS install
The **Windows QGIS LTS (Long Term Support) 3.4** should be installed via its standalone installer - [click here to download](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.4.6-2-Setup-x86_64.exe).

*Important remark: It is also possible to install it under Linux and MacOSX but given the training course format (more than 30 people), we will have only limited time to dedicate to the install hence the constraint to focus on one single Operating System, namely Windows (10 preferably and if possible). Support will be provided to install it under Linux or MacOSX if required, but outside official workshop hours.*


## QGIS plugins install
Plugins in QGIS add useful features to the software. Plugins are written by QGIS developers and other independent users who want to extend the core functionality of the software. These plugins are made available in QGIS for all the users.

To go through plugins installation process, take a look at this online tutorial: [http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/using_plugins.html](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/using_plugins.html).

In summary, to install and manage a new plugin:

```
[In QGIS top toolbar] 
Plugins ▸ Manage and Install Plugins ...
```

During this course, the following plugins will be installed (to be confirmed):
* Table Manager
* mmqgis
